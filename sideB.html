                    My old VGS was the biggest in the country with over 2000 students. One of the downsides, is the fact
                    that
                    the school is very ugly.

                  My VGS was the leading sports-school for road cyclist.
                  Every day we had minuimum two hours of training included in school day. 
                  I enjoyed my three year at this school.

                    My old school is a prestige academy for sports in northern Norway.
                    The school had a pretty old architectured structure.
                    In addition it was near my home, and football stadium.
